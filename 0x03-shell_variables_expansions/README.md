# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project focuses on mastering shell variables, expansions, initialization files, aliases, and basic arithmetic operations using Bash scripting. Each script below follows strict ALX formatting rules: exactly 2 lines, executable, and compliant with Ubuntu 20.04.
